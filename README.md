# convertToDICOM
WIP 

This is a repo exploring how to convert the TotalSegmentator training dataset to the DICOM representation. The raw image files and the labels are currently stored as nifti, and need to be converted to the DICOM and DICOM Segmentation representation respectively.  

Run the Google Colaboratory notebook to perform the conversion for a single patient.
